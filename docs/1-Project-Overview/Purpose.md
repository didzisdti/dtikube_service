## :mag_right: Project Scope: Kubernetes Orchestrated Platform
The project purpose is to explore, learn and build. Main actor in our home-lab will be lightweight Kubernetes cluster (k3s) that is resilient, fully automated and serves as a frontier to the exploration of modern technologies.

The project consists of following pillars:

1. **Infrastructure Management:** Managing Hardware, power, wiring, network and storage components. Pure focus on physical layer of the setup mimic that of a commercial environment setup. 
2. **End-to-end Automation:** Describing the automation principles applied using: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Cloud-Init, Ansible, Git Actions and Argo-CD. Automation ensures consistency and resilience (swift recovery).

3. **Observability:** *--PLANNED--* Integrated observability stack with real time alerting and log aggregation 




## :compass: Project Guiding Principles
1. **Start "Vanilla":** Learn from failure, succeed with creating something that works and move on to the next step. Avoid doing too many things and finishing none.
2. **Maintain Frugal Setup:** Maximise efficiency of resources. Infrastructure costs, server resource utilisation, manage storage requirements.  
3. **Use Open Source & CNCF:** Explore and utilise Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and other open-source technologies.
4. **Optimise and Automate:** Look to optimise first before automating any step of the solution.
5. **Continuous improvement:** Progress never stops. Look for 80/20 instead of perfection and continue learning, exploring and adjusting.
