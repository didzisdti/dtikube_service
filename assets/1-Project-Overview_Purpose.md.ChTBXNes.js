Pure focus on physical layer of the setup mimic that of a commercial environment setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>End-to-end Automation:</strong> Describing the automation principles applied using: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Cloud-Init, Ansible, Git Actions and Argo-CD. Automation ensures consistency and resilience (swift recovery).</p></li><li><p><strong>Observability:</strong> <em>--PLANNED--</em> Integrated observability stack with real time alerting and log aggregation</p></li></ol><h2 id="project-guiding-principles" tabindex="-1">🧭 Project Guiding Principles <a class="header-anchor" href="#project-guiding-principles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;:compass: Project Guiding Principles&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><strong>Start &quot;Vanilla&quot;:</strong> Learn from failure, succeed with creating something that works and move on to the next step. Avoid doing too many things and finishing none.</li><li><strong>Maintain Frugal Setup:</strong> Maximise efficiency of resources. Infrastructure costs, server resource utilisation, manage storage requirements.</li><li><strong>Use Open Source &amp; CNCF:</strong> Explore and utilise Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and other open-source technologies.</li><li><strong>Optimise and Automate:</strong> Look to optimise first before automating any step of the solution.</li><li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Progress never stops. Look for 80/20 instead of perfection and continue learning, exploring and adjusting.</li></ol>',6))])}const b=r(c,[["render",u]]);export{P as __pageData,b as default};
